# Stats220

Welcome to my repo for Stats220!

## Overview

1. This is **bold** text
2. This is *italicized* text
3. This is a link to another website: https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html

- This is a bulleted list, as was the list above
- Here's another link, just for funsies: https://www.aut.ac.nz/
- I had a guess and thought the markdown I used here would _underline_ this, but it italicized it instead. Whoops.

## Gif
It's pronounced with a hard g, right?

Anyway, last but not least:
