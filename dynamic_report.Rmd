## A look at my bus trips

I'm fortunate enough to live on a few bus lines that come frequently enough that I can turn up to the stop and hop on. However, over the past few weeks I've been wondering how reliable the buses actually are.

I collected data across all my bus trips, including over the weekends. For now, I'm just looking at summary stats, but later I'll start getting into stats by which period I took the trip in.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

logged_data <- read_csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSTT4UHNn8x65jqdUZ0VnJUEkHpoLgBjTewkbYETDMfMe5C-osB3hZizWx1Cw8SNYs4X2sFX3q4NDsX/pub?gid=497631371&single=true&output=csv")

latest_data <- rename(logged_data,
                      route = 2,
                      trip_period = 3,
                      trip_start_time = 4,
                      trip_start_etd = 5,
                      trip_start_cat = 6,
                      trip_end_time = 7,
                      trip_end_eta = 8,
                      trip_end_cat = 9,
                      trip_length_cat = 10)

## on average, is the bus late when I get to the stop?

trip_start_diff <- latest_data$trip_start_time - latest_data$trip_start_etd

trip_start_avgdiffmin <- round(mean(trip_start_diff),2)

trip_start_avgdiffsec <- round(trip_start_avgdiffmin*60,2)

```

### Comments

On average, the difference between when the bus should arrive at the start of my journey and when it actually does arrive is `r trip_start_avgdiffmin` minutes, which works out to roughly `r trip_start_avgdiffsec` seconds. In short, a negligible difference.

```{r}

trips <- length(latest_data$trip_period)

trip_start_earliest <- latest_data$trip_start_time %>% min()

trip_length_max <- max(latest_data$trip_end_time - latest_data$trip_start_time)

```

Let's have a look at some other random stats I collected. For example, of the `r trips` trips I took, the earliest I caught a bus was `r trip_start_earliest` (24 hour time). The longest I was on a single bus trip for was `r trip_length_max` minutes... which actually isn't too bad, compared to my friends from East Auckland who spend an hour on the bus each way.

Let's have a look at some graphs now.

### Graphs Graphs Graphs

```{r fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6}

ggplot(data = latest_data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = route), fill = "#a4c2f4") +
  labs(title = "I'll have my bus a la mode", 
       subtitle = "A look at what buses I catch the most", 
       x = "Route Name", 
       y = "Trips")
```

There isn't really a clear winner here, especially if you combined the 22s and 24s into one column. I kept them separated because technically they are different routes, but from where I catch them to and from it makes no difference.

```{r fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6}

ggplot(data = latest_data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = trip_start_cat, fill = trip_period)) +
  labs(title = "A Bus is Never Late, the Passengers are Merely Early", 
       subtitle = "A look at whether the buses I catch are early or late, coloured by when I caught them", 
       x = "The bus's arrival at the start of my journey was...", 
       y = "Trips")
```

This one, in theory, is a little more exciting... unfortunately the results are fairly bland. I can't say with any confidence that the buses I catch are always early, late or on time. Oh well, there you go.

```{r fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6}

ggplot(data = latest_data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = trip_length_cat), fill = "#a4c2f4") +
  labs(title = "Are we there yet?", 
       subtitle = "A look at whether once I'm on the bus the journey is shorter/longer than expected, or just on time", 
       x = "The bus journey's length was...", 
       y = "Trips")
```

Well, that's pretty conclusive! The bus trips are almost always shorter than expected, which is always a bonus. I reckon this is because the routes (mostly) go down roads that have bus lanes, so even in peak hour traffic there's no slowing us.

Anyways, thanks for sticking around! Hopefully you learnt something interesting, or something that made you wonder what it's like for you (assuming you catch public transport a lot lol).
